        <h2>For Gabriella</h2>
        <p>Among those chose happinesses with numerous aspects, i found you, one of all the reasons to always feel happy, one of the reasons that makes me want to continue to take care of you, love you, and pamper you until the end. there is alaways a space in my heartstring that makes you so special among the others, that makes you the only one who can colonize my entire mind. what is that your presence unquestionably is precious to me, because you'll always be the person i love forever.</p>
        <h2>Let me love you deeper and deeper</h2>
        <p>I realize that when you feel afraid of losing someone, that's when you feel the feeling called "endearment" i feel that feeling emerge and gnaw at every part when you feel the heartstring. i never imagined before that in the end i would fall for someone who ha so many great and unique qualities in them, someone who can make me understan the true meaning of warmth, and also someone who is able to make me dare to achieve all the things that i have dreamed od for a long time. you give me strength even in your simplest ways, i feel that i truly am always encouraged whenever you sit, and trust everything in me. believe that, until this day, you have been my best listener, a place for me to rest when i feel tired, you've become someone who always knows how to make me feel better, and somehow those things make me fall deeper into your endearment. although there are times when i look annoying in your eyes, there are times when look like i might not care about something, but in the end, i have my own thoughts about those things. i have my own way of expressing it so that it will be easier to elaborate on it later to you.</p>
        <h2>I love you, more than you know</h2>
        <p>Idurn't even know what you really feel when i say have you, but one thing is for sure that; what i express to you is real, what i try to express to you whether in the form. of words, actions, or even indirect expressions, all of that has only one answer, that i truly love you, it has became my pleasure for me personally, to have you in my life, everything feels so right as long as you're here with me. thank you for committing to me so that we can walk the same path of destiny. really, thank you for always giving me the best, and also me,  until today i admit that in any case i will try my best for you. you are such a precious person, and you deserve good treatment, both environmentally and personally, you deserve it all.</p>
        <h2>"I love you so much, so please keep remaining here with me"</h2>
        <p>All this time, I've always been looking for someone who can help me get out of my slump. i'm looking for someone who can take me away, and find my own happines. until i could meet you, someone i never even guessed that i would be with you until now, loving someone who has many unique things inside them. you, brought me to a world where it turns out there are many things that i have never explored before, you invited me to explore and find my own meaning about what endearment really is. Until i found it, and truly understand what the true meaning of endearment is; the answer is you, you are my love, my happiness, one of the best things i have ever received in my life. i admit it, that i love you so much, unconditionally more than you know.</p>
